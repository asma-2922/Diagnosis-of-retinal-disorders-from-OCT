- Designed and implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to accurately classify retinal images into four distinct categories(CNV, DME, DRUSEN, and NORMAL) while integrating model checkpoint callbacks to preserve the best-performing weights, enhancing the network's performance and reliability.
- Lastly developed a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) to deploy this model both locally and globally, ensuring seamless image classification for end-users.
